# RocketBoost
This project allowed me to experiment with other forms of inputs. I set it up so that space bar would work as a thrust for the 
rocket, and that the A and D keys would control the rotation of the rocket. In this project, I also got to create a number of 
different levels, and I was able to use methods to transition between each level. I also added a feature so that the same level 
would be reloaded in the case of failure. Overall, a really enjoyable experience.
